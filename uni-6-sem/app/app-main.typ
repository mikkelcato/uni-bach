= Introduction
Astroparticle physics is a very broad, yet niche subject. As the name suggests we want to use particle physics to explain astro-phenomena and the Universe. But we also want to use observations from astronomy to explain particle-phenomena. As an example we know from particle physics how very energetic particles behave and what light they can emit. When doing observations we see this light and can work backwards to determine or try to understand which physical processes lead to the emission. Which in turn tells us a great deal about the object we are observing.

Another part of this course is multimessenger astronomy, where we look at different _messengers_ to say something about a given object. As an example protons do not travel very freely in space since they are charged. This means they do not point back to their source. But, photons and neutrinos do. Then by comparing these types of observations we might be able to say something about where the proton came from.
