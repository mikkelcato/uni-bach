= Introduction
We want to understand quantum field theory in the presence of a non-trivial gravitational field. The simplest approach to do this is by treating the gravitational field as a classical background on which quantum fields live. The majority of these notes cover this approach. Toward the end we do consider quantum fluctuations on the background itself.

The effective field theory approach to quantum gravity we will turns out sufficient to describe e.g. the early Universe and quantum effects near black holes. A fuller description would require a more sophisticated theory like string theory.
